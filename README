This isn't meant for others to use (yet). But for the persistent,
here are some hints:

nl/

    Source code written in Nile

c/

    Compiler-generated C code. Depends on a C-based Nile runtime.
    If you're lucky, ``make -f Makefile.gcc" might get you a libgezira.a.

c/demos/
    
    Some mostly-broken demos. Depends on a libgezira.a and a C-based Nile
    runtime. If you're lucky, ``make -f Makefile.gcc snow-demo" might get
    you some falling snow.

js/

    Compiler-generated Javascript code (out-of-date)

js/demos/

    Javascript demos

hs/

    Early experiment in generating Haskell code
