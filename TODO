- Change Sampler to Texture?
- Render is strange in that is takes a stream of EdgeContributions
  I'd really like DecomposeBezier to be in the Render pipeline
- make pen stroking comparison demos
- consider issue with compositors clamping color channels
  to 1 instead of clamping to the opacity (for Porter-Duff ops,
  this is not a problem). Maybe define a color operator that
  clamps alpha first, then uses that to clamp the other channels
- Fix usage of '='. In bezier we want pairwise '=', in other
  places we want a scalar result. Perhaps define '=,=' or something
  for pairwise. Or '==' for the scalar result?
- rename Canvas to Target?
- think about restructuring Render this way:

  Mask :: (start : Point) Real >>|

  MaskCanvas (s : Sampler, c : Canvas) : Mask
      ⇒ Interleave (CreateSamplePoints (start) → s, (→)) → c (start)

  MaskSolidColor (color : Color, image : Image) : Mask
      ... primitive code ...

  RenderToMask' (m : Mask) : EdgeContribution >>|
      & [p, w, h]
          ⇒ FillBetweenEdges (p) → m (p + 0.5)

  RenderToMask (m : Mask) : EdgeContribution >>|
      ⇒ GroupBy (@p.y, SortBy (@p.x) → RenderToMask' (m))

- make zlib.nl and png.nl work
- cubic >> quadratic bezier kernel
- image filters (blur, etc.)
