- c generation
    - fill out nile.c
        - Interleave
    - fix flush_if_full and _repeat functions.
      The o buffer is passed by value, you can't set it in the function!
      must return the new o buffer!
    - rename the nile_t *n variable to nile_t *nl
    - rename nile_consume and nile_produce to nile_input and nile_output ?
    - unify "feed" like functions?
    - kernel constructor calls separate populate function?
      reuse populate function for field write back?
      what about fields that belong to "middle types"?
    - introduce _ vars back into the language
    - write SDL versions of ReadImage and WriteImage
    - demos
- fix ImageExtendModes!
- update PDF doc
- think about restructuring Render this way:

  Mask :: (start : Point) Real >>|

  MaskCanvas (s : Sampler, c : Canvas) : Mask
      ⇒ Interleave (CreateSamplePoints (start) → s, (→)) → c (start)

  MaskSolidColor (color : Color, image : Image) : Mask
      ... primitive code ...

  RenderToMask' (m : Mask) : EdgeContribution >>|
      & [p, w, h]
          ⇒ FillBetweenEdges (p) → m (p + 0.5)

  RenderToMask (m : Mask) : EdgeContribution >>|
      ⇒ GroupBy (@p.y, SortBy (@p.x) → RenderToMask' (m))

- finish pen stroking
    - fix bugs
    - find the right magic number for stroke offset curve
    - reuse joins for caps
    - miter (see formula in cairo)
    - what to do about closed pen paths?
- parser
- javascript generation
- fix font problem on windows (add missing chars to DejaVu Sans Mono and/or Inconsolata)
- make zlib.nl and png.nl real
- what about things like 2b + 0.5c
    - math mode? (single letter variables, etc.?)
      perhaps only in the body of ∀ blocks?
- cubic >> quadratic bezier kernel
- image filters (blur, etc.)
