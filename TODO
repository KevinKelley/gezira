- finish pen stroking
    - see comparison demos
    - tangency apparently is not linearly interpolated at
      't' is.
    - find crash in js reason
    - tangency might not be the right error metric. need to be
      more sensitive to ...
    - find the right magic number for stroke offset curve
      close to 0.03 now.
    - reuse joins for caps
    - miter (see formula in cairo)
    - what to do about closed pen paths?
- fix ImageExtendModes!
- think about restructuring Render this way:

  Mask :: (start : Point) Real >>|

  MaskCanvas (s : Sampler, c : Canvas) : Mask
      ⇒ Interleave (CreateSamplePoints (start) → s, (→)) → c (start)

  MaskSolidColor (color : Color, image : Image) : Mask
      ... primitive code ...

  RenderToMask' (m : Mask) : EdgeContribution >>|
      & [p, w, h]
          ⇒ FillBetweenEdges (p) → m (p + 0.5)

  RenderToMask (m : Mask) : EdgeContribution >>|
      ⇒ GroupBy (@p.y, SortBy (@p.x) → RenderToMask' (m))

- make zlib.nl and png.nl work
- cubic >> quadratic bezier kernel
- image filters (blur, etc.)
