- clip and transform
- get it to work with multiple threads
- snowflakes
- nlc
    - parse code as-is
    - nary pipeline
    - use templates?
- should pipeline kernels take more than two kernels are args
- c generation
    - keep a reference to nl in kernels so that we don't have to
      pass around nl so much.
    - on uniprocessors, we should make nile_pause relinquish the processor?
    - don't write back kernel vars that aren't prologue vars
      (i.e., no need to write parameters back)
    - optimize SortBy for when the input stream is wholly contained
      in the first input buffer. Do an in-place sort and
      just forward the input to the next kernel.
    - rename "initialized" field to something related to first_time
      or prologue or something
    - nile_feed should copy using simd mem read instructions, since
      this is the most likely place for us having to read from
      far away. (does the compiler already do this?)
    - what about the scheduling heuristic that has the thread execute
      the downstream kernel when all the output fit in one buffer?
    - what if they give us an input buffer that isn't a multiple of in_quantum?
    - handle limit on number of kernels that can be pipelined.
      we just have to split them up into multiple pipelines, not too hard?
    - document the kernel clone rules (when a kernel is referenced more that
      once in a pipeline expression)
- propagate nile-level code changes to manually generated js code
- finish pen stroking
    - see comparison demos
    - tangency apparently is not linearly interpolated at
      't' is.
    - find crash in js reason
    - tangency might not be the right error metric. need to be
      more sensitive to ...
    - find the right magic number for stroke offset curve
      close to 0.03 now.
    - reuse joins for caps
    - miter (see formula in cairo)
    - what to do about closed pen paths?
- fix ImageExtendModes!
- document (and add compiler support) for the fact that kernel parameters are
  immutable
- introduce _ vars back into the language
- update PDF doc
- think about restructuring Render this way:

  Mask :: (start : Point) Real >>|

  MaskCanvas (s : Sampler, c : Canvas) : Mask
      ⇒ Interleave (CreateSamplePoints (start) → s, (→)) → c (start)

  MaskSolidColor (color : Color, image : Image) : Mask
      ... primitive code ...

  RenderToMask' (m : Mask) : EdgeContribution >>|
      & [p, w, h]
          ⇒ FillBetweenEdges (p) → m (p + 0.5)

  RenderToMask (m : Mask) : EdgeContribution >>|
      ⇒ GroupBy (@p.y, SortBy (@p.x) → RenderToMask' (m))

- parser
- javascript generation
- fix font problem on windows (add missing chars to DejaVu Sans Mono and/or Inconsolata)
- make zlib.nl and png.nl real
- what about things like 2b + 0.5c
    - math mode? (single letter variables, etc.?)
      perhaps only in the body of ∀ blocks?
- cubic >> quadratic bezier kernel
- image filters (blur, etc.)
